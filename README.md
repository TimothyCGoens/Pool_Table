# Pool_Table

2.22.19

Version ready for submission! 

2.23.19

Fixed:
  *'v' wasn't showing all tables like it was supposed to.  It was due to my formatting the OPTIONS MENU.

Added:
  *Try/Excepts to the table selection/table return menu
  *Tables cannot be checked out if they are already in use and cannot be checked in if they aren't checked out

2.24.19

Added:
 *Changed the naming of the .txt file so that it has the date. Side effect is that I would now get a new file for every day for book keeping!
